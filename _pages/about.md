Hello!

My name is Camelia. I am a long time music enthusiast from Durham, North Carolina with a penchant for physical retail.

I'm currently based in Brooklyn, New York, and I have worked in the music industry since 2012, previously working at Domino Recording Company and Merge Records.

 My goal is to help improve the music experience for music fans, artists, and labels.

 In a time where so much about the music industry is uncertain, it seems more important than ever for teams and individuals working within the music industry to be innovative, collaborative, and efficient.

 xo,

 Camelia
